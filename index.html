    <H1> "About Me"</H1>
        <p> Hello, my name is Anthonia Hinkson. I am a recent graduate from North Carolina 
            A&T State University. I am new to coding, however I love problem solving
            and helping others. I have created this page to showcase what I have
            learned in the first full week of the coding bootcamp at 
            <abbr>University of North Carolina at Charlotte</abbr> 
        </p>
