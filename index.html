         <p class ="first element"> Hello, my name is Anthonia Hinkson. I am a recent graduate from North Carolina 
            A&T State University. I am new to coding, however I love problem solving
            and helping others. I have created this page to showcase what I have
            learned in the first full week of the coding bootcamp at 
            University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>
